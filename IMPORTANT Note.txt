I was getting the 504: Endpoint request timed out error frequently without SQS queues between API Gateway and Lambda.
The max API timeout is 29 seconds and if our lambda takes more than that, the request is gonna timeout.
Remember, our code uses model to predict and then make an entry in RDS, which could take more than 29 seconds.
So passing on the messages to SQS queue will not take more than 29 seconds and also lambda can read from the SQS queue to ensure no messages are lost.
