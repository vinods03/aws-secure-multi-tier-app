Note that the Certificate is tied to Route 53 domain and Route 53 domain (A record) is tied to ALB.
If you delete existing cerificate and procure a new certificate for your domain, make sure you update all the 3 "ingress resources" in kube-manifests to point to thjis new certificate.
Else your ALB will be tied to an old certificate that no longer exists and the link Certificate - Route 53 A record - ALB is broken.
Your app will not work.
